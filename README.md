The repo where I solve coding problems from [DailyCodingProblems](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/). 

## Problem5
cons(a, b) constructs a pair, and car(pair) and cdr(pair) returns the first and last element of that pair.<br>
For example, car(cons(3, 4)) returns 3, and cdr(cons(3, 4)) returns 4.<br>
Implement car and cdr.<br>

## Problem4
Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space.<br>
In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.<br>
For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.<br>
You can modify the input array in-place.<br>

## Problem3
Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a string, and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into the tree.<br>

## Problem2
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.<br>
For example, if our input was \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be \[120, 60, 40, 30, 24].<br>
If our input was \[3, 2, 1], the expected output would be \[2, 3, 6].<br>

## Problem1
Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.<br>
For example, given \[10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.<br>
